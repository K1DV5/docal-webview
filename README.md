# docal-webview

**NOTE:** This project is abandoned in favor of
https://github.com/K1DV5/docal-tkinter As the project involves a lot of math
rendering, this webview implementation was not performing very good. Also, the
common shortcuts like save, open, etc. could not be remapped. The problem with
other ways (e.g. Tkinter) was that there was no library to render the math. But
that problem has now been solved by developing the library,
https://github.com/K1DV5/tkinter-math as a new project.

This is a GUI for https://github.com/K1DV5/docal implemented as a webview
desktop app using pywebview. It uses KaTeX for the preview math rendering.
